# multitasking

This repository provides codes needed to reproduce the figures in the paper "Multi-tasking via baseline control in recurrent neural networks" by S. Ogawa, F. Fumarola, and L. Mazzucato. A preprint is available on arXiv at https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06884 and the published version is scheduled to appear soon in PNAS.
